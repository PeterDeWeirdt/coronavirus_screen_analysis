# Coronavirus Screen Analysis
Analysis notebooks for the manuscript: Wei, Jin et al. "Genome-wide CRISPR screens of multiple pathogenic coronaviruses reveal host factors critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection." *Cell* (2020)

We have included a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to generate a reproducible python environment. See the [pipenv website](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for more details.

We have also included an [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/collaborating.html) for creating a reproducible r environment.
